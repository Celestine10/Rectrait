            This website uses an ML model to predict your personality. The dataset used for training the model can be

            The classification is done based on Multinomial Logistic Regression.

            Whenever a user takes up the test, the input is given to the ML model and the model predicts the
            personality trait of the user.

            <b>Multinomial Logistic Regression</b> <br>
            Multinomial Logistic Regression is a clever classification technique that extends the logistic regression algorithm
            to solve possible outcome problems that a of multiclass, given one or more independent variables.
            
            This model is one of two extensions (the othe being OVR) used to predict the probabilities of categorically dependent variable, 
            which has two or more possible outcomes. Whereas the logistic regression model is used when the dependent categorical
            variable has two outcome classes for example, students can either “Pass” or “Fail” in an exam or bank
            can either “Grant” or “Reject” the loan application for a person.

            Since the binary logistic regression model's probability adds up to 1, it should also be noted that no matter how many classes need to be predicted, 
            the individual class probability values still add up to a total of 1 while the most probable class will be predicted by the model.
